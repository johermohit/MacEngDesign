## Advancing Inclusive Engineering Education

Our education research team explores the integration of equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA) in engineering education to better understand the value of design thinking as a tool for fostering inclusivity.

Using surveys and students’ engineering design course reflection assignments, we examine how learning equity-based design influences their perceptions of inclusivity and belonging. Findings from our initial research suggest that engaging in reflexive practice and experiential learning empowers students to challenge biases and value diverse perspectives in design.

We expanded on this work to compare student experiences in design versus non-design courses and showed that design courses fostered greater awareness of biases, inclusivity, and social impact. In addition, learner-centered, empathetic design approaches can improve accessibility and help address systemic barriers faced by underrepresented students in engineering.

Collectively, our research underscores the need for integrating equity-based design principles into engineering curricula to create inclusive learning environments and empower students to apply socially conscious design in their work.

## Empathetic Design with Students as Partners

This work highlights an evolving focus on empathetic, student-centered learning in engineering education, emphasizing the role of identity, vulnerability, and reflection in fostering a transformative mindset. Initial research revealed the impact of cultural identity on students' approaches to design thinking, underscoring how self-identity influences creative confidence and openness to failure.

Building on this, empathetic design methods were applied in science and engineering courses, using empathy maps and focus groups to collaboratively identify learning challenges and generate new teaching ideas. Scandinavian practices around teaching portfolios further inform this approach by encouraging regular reflective discussions on teaching philosophies, helping educators adopt similar reflections on identity and empathy in their pedagogy.

These insights advocate for integrating students’ lived experiences into design education, enhancing inclusivity and retention by making learning personally meaningful.
