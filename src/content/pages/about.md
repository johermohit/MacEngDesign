## Who are we?

We are a collective of faculty, students, and community partners at McMaster University reimagining what it means to teach and learn engineering. Our team brings together diverse lived experiences and disciplines to pioneer new models of education that bridge theory and practice.

Through community-based design projects, research on inclusive pedagogy, and student-led initiatives, we create learning environments where empathy, equity, and collaboration are central. Together, we are cultivating a culture of engineering that is as human-centred as it is technically rigorous.

## What do we believe?

We believe engineering means more than technical mastery and engineering education should be reimagined to reflect the complexity of the world it serves. Our students are not only skilled scientists, problem-solvers, and communicators - they are curious, agile thinkers who bring a diversity of ideas and perspectives to the table.

True innovation happens when analytical precision meets empathy, when human-centred perspectives are valued alongside technical expertise. By embracing this diversity of thought, we can prepare engineers who design not just solutions, but meaningful change in the world.
