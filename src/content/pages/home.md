# Engineering Empathy

Engineering education is evolving to embrace human-centered, equity-driven approaches that prepare students to address complex societal challenges. At McMaster University, faculty and students are pioneering innovative teaching and learning models that integrate design thinking, empathy, and inclusivity into engineering.

We are building a future where technical mastery meets human understanding.
