## Community-Based Experiential Learning

Our design work completed in partnership with diverse members of the educational team demonstrates a robust community-based, experiential learning approach within the Master of Engineering Design Program at McMaster University, emphasizing healthcare design.

Through partnerships with St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton, Patient and Family Advisors (PFAs), and interdisciplinary collaborations, students gain firsthand insights into patient needs, reframing healthcare design challenges from a patient-centered perspective.

Projects such as **myIPF**, which supports patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, showcase how students co-design practical solutions informed by patient experiences, yielding both educational and community impact.

Interdisciplinary program improvements in the School of Engineering Practice and Technology further strengthen these experiential learning pathways by addressing complex societal challenges, such as virtual care and sustainability, to foster inclusion and expand community collaboration. This co-design model nurtures a culture of empathy, trust, and innovation in healthcare education, preparing students to address real-world challenges with a human-centered mindset.

## Inclusive Innovation

The Inclusive Innovation Design workshops aimed to foster a more inclusive engineering culture by helping students recognize their diverse identities and integrate equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA) principles into their work.

Co-designed by three engineering students, two recent graduates, and a faculty member at McMaster University, the first workshop introduced incoming graduate engineering students to self-identity, positionality, and equity-based design. Participants engaged in a human-centered design sprint, using personas and journey mapping to address real-world challenges.

The success of this initial workshop led to the design of a second workshop that focussed on working collaboratively to build trust within design teams. Participants explored the impact our values have on creative confidence in the design process. This initiative underscores the impact of student-led co-design in fostering inclusive engineering education and highlights the need to embed EDIA in curricula to enhance learning and belonging for underrepresented students.
